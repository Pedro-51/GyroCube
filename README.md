Added new [BLE firmware](esp32_cube_vBLE_en/) this has a browser based config tool (can be use on android/mac/pc via chrome). This firmware is backwards compatible with other app config methods (Bluetooth Serial, Pedro android app). I however think the new BLE tool is superior. I'm a little biased but try it you'll see. no need to host the app i set it up on hosting that should never go away https://idoxa55.sufydely.com/cubeConfigTool.html. ![screenshot](pictures/bleQRCode.png)
